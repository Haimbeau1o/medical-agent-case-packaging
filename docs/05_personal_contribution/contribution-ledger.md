# Personal Contribution Ledger

## Ownership Summary
- Role: AI Application Engineer intern-level owner for routing architecture, evaluation closure, and interview-grade packaging.

## Contribution Entries (SAIRL)
### 1) Safety-first routing strategy
- Situation: high-risk medical queries were vulnerable to misrouting.
- Action: decomposed decision pipeline into four layers with deterministic controls.
- Intelligence: used AI-assisted pattern mining to identify high-risk trigger terms quickly.
- Result: enabled auditable risk controls and stable fallback behavior.
- Learning: deterministic + model hybrid is superior to unconstrained direct generation in this domain.

### 2) Reproducible offline evaluation loop
- Situation: implementation existed, but interview-proof evidence was missing.
- Action: standardized replay dataset and metric script pathing.
- Intelligence: used AI-assisted drafting to accelerate metric dictionary and evidence ledger structure.
- Result: top-line metrics and error taxonomy became reproducible with explicit scope tags.
- Learning: reproducibility is a stronger interview signal than isolated metric claims.

### 3) Error-driven iteration prioritization
- Situation: aggregate accuracy hid safety-critical misses.
- Action: introduced E1/E2/E3/E6 breakdown and risk-priority ordering.
- Intelligence: used AI to cluster mismatch patterns and draft remediation playbooks.
- Result: iteration sequence now aligns with business risk, not vanity metrics.
- Learning: risk-weighted optimization produces better real-world narrative and governance.

# AI-Accelerated Problem Solving Cases

## Case 1: Fast Error Pattern Discovery
- Problem: manual review of mismatch pairs was slow.
- AI usage: used coding assistant to quickly compute confusion hotspots and summarize top failure pairs.
- Human decision: selected fixes based on medical risk, not frequency alone.
- Output: prioritized remediation list linked to E1/E2/E3/E6.

## Case 2: SOP Drafting with Guardrails
- Problem: project narrative was fragmented and non-standard.
- AI usage: generated first-pass SOP drafts and template skeletons.
- Human decision: enforced strict evidence policy and compliance boundary edits.
- Output: reusable SOP pack with merge-ready quality gates.

## Case 3: Interview Simulation and Defense
- Problem: strong metrics but weak defense under pressure questioning.
- AI usage: generated adversarial interview questions across architecture, compliance, and metrics.
- Human decision: curated defensible answers tied to evidence ledger.
- Output: 20-question deep-dive pack with short and long answer modes.

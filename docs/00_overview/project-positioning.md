# Project Positioning

## One-liner
Build and package a safety-first medical inquiry routing system with reproducible evaluation and interview-ready engineering narratives.

## Positioning for Large Tech Interviews
This project is positioned as an AI application engineering case, not a model-only research demo. The emphasis is on:
- layered decision architecture,
- risk control and human escalation,
- measurable evaluation loop,
- production-oriented process discipline.

## Value Statement
- Business value: reduce high-risk misrouting and improve service stability.
- Engineering value: turn ad-hoc implementation into a repeatable SOP.
- Candidate value: show ownership across architecture, metrics, quality gates, and retrospective iteration.

## Non-Goals
- Not claiming autonomous medical diagnosis.
- Not claiming full online deployment metrics.
- Not replacing licensed physician workflow.

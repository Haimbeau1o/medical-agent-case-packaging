# Incident and Retrospective SOP

## Incident Intake
1. Log incident with timestamp, scene, and risk level.
2. Classify error type (E1/E2/E3/E6).
3. Link affected claim IDs in evidence ledger.

## Triage
- P0: compliance/safety critical, immediate escalation.
- P1: major functional degradation.
- P2: quality/performance issue without safety impact.

## Root Cause Template
- Trigger condition
- Faulty module/layer
- Why existing gate missed it
- Corrective action
- Preventive action

## Retro Output
- What changed in rules/threshold/config
- What metric moved (with scope)
- What new guardrail was added
- Owner and due date

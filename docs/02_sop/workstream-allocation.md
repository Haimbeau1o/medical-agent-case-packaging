# Workstream Allocation

## Team Topology
- Workstream A Owner: system architecture and routing design
- Workstream B Owner: evidence, metrics, and reproducibility
- Workstream C Owner: compliance boundaries and release gates
- Workstream D Owner: personal narrative and interview assets

## Handoff Contract
Each workstream deliverable must include:
1. objective
2. output artifact path
3. evidence references
4. risks and open questions
5. review checklist

## Weekly Rhythm
- Daily async update in issue comments.
- Mid-week integration review (A+B first, then C+D).
- Final weekly merge after all validators pass.
